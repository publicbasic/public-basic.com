					You already know that you need to increase your optimisation capability.
				</h3>
				<h3>
					But how do you get started?
				</h3>
				<p>
					Experienced talent is scarce and difficult to hire.
				</p>
				<p>
					Agencies are a great way to get started but are opaque about their processes, delivering short-term results but without having leaving a lasting impact on your team or your process.
				</p>
				<p>
					We take a different approach.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the training and battle hardened processes, we can help you to establish an enterprise scale optimisation engine at the very heart of your business using your existing team.

				<h1>How we can help</h1>
				<h2>Roadmap definition</h2>
				<p>At the start of our engagement, we will assess your internal capabilities, processes, strategy, and technology as well as working to understand your business goals and challenges.</p>
				<p>
					Drawing from our experience across a diverse range of industries, we then build out a comprehensive roadmap for your business.
				</p>
				<p>
					We focus on providing actionable initiatives to address immediate challenges, generating short-term wins while also providing a framework to drive long-term growth.
				</p>
				<h2 class="mt-5">Team training</h2>
				<p>
 Finding people with CRO expertise is tough.
				</p>
				<p>
					The disciple is reasonably new, and finding people with the unique combination of expertise isn't just difficult. It’s practically impossible.
				</p>
				<p>
					In desperation, many businesses end up hiring people with 'CRO experience' who ultimately turn out to be inexperienced and unsuitable, despite having some of the right keywords in their CV.
				</p>
				<div class="py-3 px-3" style="background-color: #FFFF88;"><p class="mb-0">
						Instead of struggling to hire CRO people, we <em>make</em> CRO people.</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					Through close collaboration and expert training, we will turn your existing Product Managers, UX designers, User Researchers, Developers and BA's into a crack optimisation team.
				</p>

				<h2 class="mt-5">Building a culture of optimisation</h2>
				<p>
					A strong culture is the foundation on which any successful optimisation program is built.
				</p>
				<p>
					By working in close collaboration, our partnership will help to foster a data-driven testing culture within your business.
				</p>
				<p>
					We aim to promote a culture in which optimisation is a central practice in which the entire team participates and one which is aligned around the importance of measuring, assessing and improving performance.
				</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li>
						<strong>Courageous</strong> – Being bold, unafraid of questioning the status quo, challenging conventional wisdom and 'best practise'
					</li>
					<li><strong>Inclusive</strong> – Great test concepts can come from anywhere (and often do)</li>
					<li><strong>Collaborative</strong> – Sharing knowledge, skills and ideas</li>
					<li><strong>Data-driven</strong> – Basing decisions on data over intuition</li>
					<li><strong>Fun</strong> – Setting up challenges around predicted results</li>
					<li><strong>Infectious</strong> – Great optimisation builds a virtuous cycle as results circulate throughout the business, building momentum and buy in</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Design, develop and implement tests</h2>
				<p>
					While we're building up your internal capability, you can rely on us to help you hit the ground running.
				</p>
				<p>
					With our flexible engagement model, in the beginning, we’ll be highly involved in each and every test.
				</p>
				<p>
					We can help with researching test concepts and hypothesis formation, design, UX, development, QA, the whole enchilada.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over time, we work to equip your team with the skills, processes and methodologies required so that they’re increasingly self-sufficient.
				</p>
