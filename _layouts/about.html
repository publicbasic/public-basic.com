    <p>
 â€¨I ran my first A/B test in 2008 while contracting UK to a no-win/no-fee law firm in the UK.
</p>
<p>
They were spending upwards of Â£100/click for the keyword â€˜Mesotheliomaâ€™ (thatâ€™s absestos cancer to you and me) to recruit claimants for class action law suits. With a few tests, we managed to halve their (enormous) cost of customer acquisition.</p>
<p>
In the words of David Ogilvy, "I had tasted blood."
</p>
<p>
Now based back in Melbourne, I work with a small team of developers, designers and copywriters to run optimisation programs for some of the biggest companies in Australia and around the world.
</p>
<p>
â€¨Iâ€™ve had my work featured on the <a href="https://blog.optimizely.com/2016/07/13/how-does-page-load-time-impact-engagement/">Optimizely blog</a>, organise the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CRO-Melbourne/">CRO Melbourne</a> meet-up and have spoken at <a href="https://conversionconference.co.uk/">Conversion Conference</a> and <a href="http://sydney.measurecamp.org/">Measure Camp</a>. 
</p>
<h2 class="mt-5">Nice words from clients</h2>

<p>
"They have helped us to improve our site immenselyâ€”not just by boosting conversion but also by helping us identify which areas are worth investing in. Ollee works really closely with us and has helped us grow our knowledge immensely"</p>
<p class="text-center text-xs">

  &mdash;John Ungar, Digital CX Manager, Kmart Australia</p>

<p class="mt-5">
"If you are an Australian organisation that is lucky enough to have Ollee fall into your lap, grab him with both hands - he will make a demonstrable difference to your process and your bottom line."</p>
<p class="text-center text-xs">

&mdash;Jane Austin, Head of UX, Telegraph Media Group
</p>


<p class="mt-5">
"Tenacity and confidence to question the status quo are two of Oliver's key strengths. He has done a fantastic job navigating through many changing tools and environments, adding value by rapidly assimilating data into opportunities and looking beyond the surface thanks to his broad knowledge and customer focus."
