hero-p: By applying user-centred design techniques, I strive to understand user needs,
  motivations and pain points. <br /> <br /> Once I know all about your customers
  and what drives them, I channel that knowledge into improving your site and transforming
  it a lean, mean conversion machine by running validated experiments at scale. <br

  by this customer-centric, data-driven approach.
