## What is A/B testing?

Most companies guess about what to put on their website. 

Yes, most websites are huge big money leaking teetering towers of guesswork and assumptions.

They pump in money via paid marketing channels left right and centre, measuring ‘hits’ and ‘impressions’ while neglecting performance entirely.

* While you’re still pumping in money like it’s 1999 (dear reader: this metaphor is intended as a Prince reference but could equally refer to the heady days of the pre dot com bubble) all of your new traffic is bouncing, dropping out and exit the site entirely while you haven’t even noticed because you’re not measuring the right stuff.

* What’s our favourite way to topple these towers of illusion and hearsay you ask?
* Well, analytics is useful for a start but once that’s in place...A/B testing

* A/B testing is a hugely powerful and magical (yeah, we think it’s a big magical) tool which gives you the power to stop GUESSING and start LEARNING about what your customers want, what is intuitive and straightforward to them. 
* One of our favourite clients is Kmart (are we allowed to have favourites? Well, we do) the famous Australian retailer. 
* When we first started working with them a few years ago they would spend countless hours every day debating which products should be featured on their homepage. Not just what products, but what photo and with what headline.
* They did this because they thought that moving different modules around on the homepage and featuring, say, a trampoline instead of a frying pan or a pair of shoes would increase trampoline sales and revenue per customer.
* The problem was that they had no way to measure the impact of these decisions which were sucking up hours of an otherwise busy day.
* So, we tested it.
* You know what happened?
* Whatever combination of products we displayed on the Kmart homepage, no matter how clever or feel good our headlines were... it didn’t impact on sales one bit.
* Most people that want to buy a trampoline from Kmart are going to buy a trampoline from Kmart (and they more than likely won’t see the homepage at all) and some nice merchandising is unlikely to push this figure up,
* What a relief!
* The team stopped agonising over homepage tiles and were left to do its their energy on actually making their site better for customers in meaningful ways.

The greatest, most customer centric companies in the world are A/B testing all the time (and you don’t even know it)

* Amazon
* Netflix
* Google
* Airbnb

Jeff Bezos says;

X, Y, Z

How does it work?

* Technically, A/B testing works by sitting on TOP of your site.
* We use a tool (Optimizely is great, Google also make one called Optimize, Adobe have Target, etc.) that sits on TOP of your site which allows us to make changes to it without begging your internal IT team to prioritise our Jira tickets,

Stop waiting around for your IT team

* Once the the testing platform has been installed, we’re free to make and deploy new experiences on your live site completely independent of your internal IT team.
* Sounds a bit too good to be true, right? 
* Without delving too deep into technical waffle we use client side JavaScript to modify the experience on your site for a portion of users,

Real life example of we used A/B Testing to make customers happier (and our client more money)

* Let’s say that you’re a car manufacturer and you want to run an A/B test on your Test Drive Request Form.
* This is an actual test that we worked on for one our clients which lead to a 50% increase in lead generation and millions of dollars in incremental revenue.
* Your form is the longest out of any car company in Australia and possible the world.
* Instead of asking customers for their their name and telephone number (which, incidentally, when we interviewed the dealers is the only two pieces of data they’re concerned with) you ask them for 11 different fields, including some dodgy lead qualified stuff that rang alarm bells with our research group (“when do you want to buy?)
* Your research tells you that all these fields ring alarm bells with customers (who don’t trust car dealers one iota) and the DEALERS THEMSELVES say that they only need a name and a telephone number.
* But your CRM is hard coded into a 1989 model IBM mainframe which sits on your basement data centre tended by weirdly beards technicians and there’s no way to send a test drive request without all 11 fields without breaking the system entirely.
* Or is there?
* This is the sort of problem that we can (and regularly do) address with A/B testing.
* Using JavaScript, we built a snippet of code which hid all of the extra 9 form fields and in the background filled then out with dummy data.
* Half of the visitors to this page were served the original version and half were served our new one,
* Our client’s internal IT team didn’t have to lift a finger.
* After running the experiment for a month we had accumulated enough data to prove that making these changes generated a 50% lift in test drive requests and millions of extra dollars of revenue.
* This gave our client the data that they needed to build a business case for a CRM upgrade.
* In the meantime, we used our A/B testing platform to continue serving the shorter form to ALL visitors.

This is a perfectly normal example of how we use A/B testing to make our client’s websites better for their visitors and more profitable for them (or their boss, or their bank manager or whoever).

We find that the companies that get the best results are medium to large sized businesses. 

If you make less than $1m a year from your website, whatever improvements we can help you make will probably be gobbled up by our fees.

You will also likely not have enough traffic to gain sufficient momentum to run enough tests quickly enough to gain a result.
