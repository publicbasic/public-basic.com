### Why do this?

Most websites are great big piles of guesses, 'best practise' and mindlessly copying their competitors. Using A/B testing in conjunction with [user research](/services/user-research) allows us to systematically deconstruct your website to  validate which parts work and which ones don't.

By carefully designing hypothesis-driven experiments we can trial alternative designs, messages, product features (and just about anything else you can think about it) on your real live site, with your real users, in real time.

A/B testing software allows us to bypass your internal dev team and quickly deploy live 'prototypes' on your site. That means we can get experiments up and running and in days, not weeks or months.


We've used A/B testing to help:

<ul class="list">
<li>Identify the right commercial threshold for offering free postage for a department store</li>
<li>Reduce in-bound customer support calls for a telco</li>
<li>Increase home loan appointments for a bank</li>
</ul>

Contact us for case studies and other applications across different industries.

### How we do it

#### User-centred discovery

We comb through piles of data and conduct rigorous user research sessions to find the parts of your website that users find difficult or confusing or otherwise problematic. 

#### Hypothesis formation & prioritsation	
Organising the insights from our research into themes, we'll formulate a range of proposed solutions for how we might overcome those issues. Together we'll prioritise according to ROI and effort.
 
#### Results-focused testing

We deploy multiple test variations in design, functionality, copy (and so on) your ‘problem’ page them serve them to a split audience to see which variant performs best. Once we've identified a winner, we can work with your internal dev team to get it live (and serve it too 100% of traffic via our testing tool in the interim).

#### Long-term strategy

We’ll help you get some ‘quick wins’ but our approach ensures that changes keep delivering in the long term. 

The best way to help you deliver the best experience for your customer is io help you operate your own optimisation program. Over the years, we've engaged in this way with scores of clients to help them build their own internal capacity.
